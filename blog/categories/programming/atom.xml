    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the nicest things you can do as a programmer is to leave detailed notes
for the future programmers who must maintain your code. Especially since the
most likely maintainer of your code is you.</p>

<p>If you've done anything complicated or non-obvious, leave an explanation of
what you did and <em>why you did it</em>. If your implementation is incomplete or
suboptimal, leave a detailed note about what should be done next. This is not
a substitute for actual communication with members of your team, but it makes
things so much nicer for the next person who touches the code.</p>

<p>I've gotten in the habit of leaving myself a note whenever I need to stop what
I'm doing, even if I only expect the interruption to last a few minutes. (When
does that ever happen?) Sometimes the note is just a short sentence about what
I was doing. Two nights ago, at 2am before going to bed, I left the following
paragraph in the code.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>I am so thoughtful.  </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Today as I jumped back into the code, my present self thanked my 2am self for
being so thoughtful. Obviously I was not fully coherent, but I was able to
dump the contents of my brain before powering down. This saved me a lot of
time I otherwise would have spent figuring out what the heck I was doing.</p>

<p>One thing to note about this comment: it doesn't compile. I consistently use
the all-caps phrase "START HERE", and I usually put it outside a comment. The
next time I try to compile, big red errors will force me to read my note.
Whenever you can easily force yourself to do the right thing, do it.</p>

<p>And that's why you always leave a note.</p>
