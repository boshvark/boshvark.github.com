My name is Michael Thelen and I run Boshvark Software, LLC. We specialize in
developing apps for iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad. We also provide consulting
services and application development for Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows. Our
most popular application is [Zyzzyva](http://zyzzyva.net/), a cross-platform
word study program used by top Scrabble&reg; players around the world.

And by we, I mean me. Yeah, pretty much just me. I am also employed as a
full-time software developer. I enjoy a good challenge and love learning new
things, and I especially enjoy sharing what I've learned.

I'm excited to use this blog to discuss programming, consulting, productivity,
small business, or whatever topics I find interesting in the world of
computers and technology. I hope you enjoy it too.
