One of the nicest things you can do as a programmer is to leave detailed notes
for the future programmers who must maintain your code. Especially since the
most likely future maintainer of your code is you.

I've gotten in the habit of leaving myself a note whenever I need to stop what
I'm doing, even if I only expect the interruption to last a few minutes.
